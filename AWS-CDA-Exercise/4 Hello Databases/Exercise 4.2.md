#Exercise 4.2
##Spin Up the MariaDB Database Instance
Use the Python SDK to spin up your MariaDB database hosted on Amazon RDS.

To spin up the MariaDB database, run the following script and update the Variables
section to meet your needs:

```
# Excercise 4.2
import boto3
import json
import datetime

# Just a quick helper function for date time conversions, in case you want to
   print the raw JSON
def date_time_converter(o):
    if isinstance(o, datetime.datetime):
        return o.__str__()

# Variables
sg_name = 'rds-sg-dev-demo'
rds_identifier = 'my-rds-db'
db_name = 'mytestdb'
user_name = 'masteruser'
user_password = 'mymasterpassw0rd1!'
admin_email = 'myemail@myemail.com'
sg_id_number = ''
rds_endpoint = ''

# We need to get the Security Group ID Number to use in the creation of the RDS
   Instance
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2_client.describe_security_groups(
    GroupNames=[
        sg_name
    ])

sg_id_number = json.dumps(response['SecurityGroups'][0]['GroupId'])
sg_id_number = sg_id_number.replace('"','')

# Create the client for Amazon RDS
rds_client = boto3.client('rds')

# This will create our MariaDB Database
# NOTE: Here we are hardcoding passwords for simplicity and testing purposes
   only! In production
# you should never hardcode passwords in configuration files/code!
# NOTE: This will create an MariaDB Database. Be sure to remove it when you are
   done.
response = rds_client.create_db_instance(
    DBInstanceIdentifier=rds_identifier,
    DBName=db_name,
    DBInstanceClass='db.t2.micro',
    Engine='mariadb',
    MasterUsername='masteruser',
    MasterUserPassword='mymasterpassw0rd1!',
    VpcSecurityGroupIds=[
        sg_id_number
    ],
    AllocatedStorage=20,
    Tags=[
        {
            'Key': 'POC-Email',
            'Value': admin_email
        },
        {
            'Key': 'Purpose',
            'Value': 'AWS Developer Study Guide Demo'
        }
    ]
)

# We need to wait until the DB Cluster is up!
print('Creating the RDS instance. This may take several minutes...')
waiter = rds_client.get_waiter('db_instance_available')
waiter.wait(DBInstanceIdentifier=rds_identifier)
```
print('Okay! The Amazon RDS Database is up!')
After the script has executed, the following message is displayed:
```
Creating the RDS instance. This may take several minutes.
```
After the Amazon RDS database instance has been created successfully, the following
confirmation is displayed:
```
Okay! The Amazon RDS Database is up!
```
You can also view these messages from the Amazon RDS console.
