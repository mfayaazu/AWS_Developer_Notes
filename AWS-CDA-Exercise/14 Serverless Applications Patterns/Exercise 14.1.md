*https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/*.
2.	To create a new ElastiCache cluster, begin the launch and configuration process.
3.	For **Cluster engine**, choose **Memcached** and configure the cluster name, number of nodes, and node type.
4.	(Optional) Configure the security group and maintenance window as needed.
5.	Review the cluster configuration, and begin provisioning the cluster. Connect to the cluster with any Memcached client by using the DNS name of the cluster.
