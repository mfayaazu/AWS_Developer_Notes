#Exercise 14.2
##Expand the Size of a memcached Cluster
In this exercise, you will expand the size of an existing Amazon ElastiCache Memcached cluster.
1.	Launch a Memcached cluster by following the steps in the previous exercise.
2.	Navigate to the Amazon ElastiCache dashboard, and view the configuration of your existing cluster.
3.	View the list of nodes that are currently being used, and then add one new node by increasing the number of nodes.
4.	Apply the changes to the configuration, and wait for the new node to finish provisioning.
5.	Confirm that the new node has been provisioned, and connect to the node using a Memcached client.

You have horizontally scaled an existing ElastiCache cluster by adding a new cache node.
