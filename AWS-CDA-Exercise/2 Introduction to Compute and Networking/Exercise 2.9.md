# Exercise 2.9## Launch an AWS Cloud9 InstanceIn this exercise, you’ll launch an Amazon EC2 instance that you will create in the AWSCloud9 service. You will connect to this Amazon EC2 instance from the AWS Cloud9console. You will then use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to edit files, build software, and execute commands on the terminal from your web browser.	1. To display the AWS Cloud9 dashboard, select Services ➢ Cloud9.	2. Select Create Environment.	3. For Name, enter devassoc-c9 and then select Next step.	4. Select Network settings ➢ Advanced.	5. Select Network (VPC) ➢ Amazon VPC ID (copied earlier).
	6. Select Subnet ➢ Subnet ID for the Public VPC (copied earlier).	7. Select Next step ➢ Create environment.	8. When the AWS Cloud9 environment loads, run the following in the AWS Cloud9 terminal. Make sure to replace the IP address in the example command with the address you copied earlier for private-instance.		curl private-ip	9. From the private-instance, download the MP3 audio to devassoc-c9 using curl as	follows:		curl private-ip-address/instance.mp3 --output instance.mp3	10. To preview the file, in the navigation pane, double-click instance.mp3.	11. Open README.md in a text editor.You now have a managed development environment in AWS that is connected to yourisolated VPC.
