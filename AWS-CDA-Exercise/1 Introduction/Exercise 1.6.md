# Exercise 1.6## Working with Multiple RegionsIn this exercise, you’ll use Amazon Polly to understand the effects of working withdifferent AWS Regions.	1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder with the book sample code.	2. Navigate to chapter-01 in the folder where you downloaded the sample code.	3. Verify that the region is us-east-1 by running the following command:			aws configure get region
	4. Upload aws-lexicon.xml to the Amazon Polly service in the default region, which is		US East (N. Virginia).			aws polly put-lexicon --name awsLexicon --content file://aws-lexicon.xml	5. The file helloaws.py is currently overriding the region to be EU (London). Run the		Python code and observe the LexiconNotFoundException that returns.			python.helloaws.py	6. Upload the lexicon to EU (London) by setting the region to eu-west-2.			aws polly put-lexicon --name awsLexicon --content			file://aws-lexicon.xml --region eu-west-2	7. Run the following Python script again:			python helloaws.py		Observe that it executes successfully this time and generates an MP3 file in the		current		folder.	8. Play the generated helloaws.mp3 file to confirm that it says, “Hello Amazon Web		Services.”	9. (Optional) Delete the lexicons with the following commands:			aws polly delete-lexicon --name awsLexicon			aws polly delete-lexicon --name awsLexicon --region eu-west-2Even though the text supplied by the API call to synthesize speech was “Hello AWS!,”the generated audio file uses the lexicon you uploaded to pronounce it as “Hello AmazonWeb Services.”
