#Exercise 1.5##Run a Python Script that Makes AWS API CallsIn this exercise, you’ll run the Python script to make an AWS API call.		
	1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder with the book sample code.	2. To install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto), run the following command:			pip install boto3	3. Navigate to the chapter-01 folder where you downloaded the sample code.	4. To generate an MP3 in the chapter-01 folder, run the helloworld.py program.			python helloworld.py	5. To hear the audio, open the generated file, helloworld.mp3.	6. (Optional) Modify the Python code to use a different voice. See Exercise 1.3 for an		AWS CLI command that provides the list of available voices.You hear “Hello World” when you play the generated audio file. If you completed theoptional challenge, you also hear the audio spoken in a different voice from the first audio.
