# Elastic Beanstalk

#### *Elastic Beanstalk* is a developer centric view of deploying application on AWS.
- A managed service
  - Instance configuration
  - OS is handled by Beanstalk
  - Deployment strategy is configurableut performed by Beanstalk
  - Application code configurable
- It will leverage all the AWS components that we have gone over thus far:
  - EC2
  - ASG
  - ELB
  - RDS
  - Etc..
- Elastic Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
- Three architecture models:
  - Single instance deployment: good for developers
  - LB + ASG: great for production or staging web applications
  - ASG only: great for non-web apps in production
- Elastic Beanstalk has three components:
  - Application
  - Application Version (Each deployment gets assigned a version)
  - Environment name (dev, staging, prod): free naming
- You deploy application versions to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment
- Rollback feature to previous application versions
- Full control over the lifecycle of environments
- Support for many platforms:
  - Go
  - Java
  - Python
  - Node.js
  - Ruby
  - Single Container Docker
  - Multi Container Docker
  - Preconfigure Docker
  - Write your own custom platforms (If the any of the above is not supported)
